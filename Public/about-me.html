    <h1>About Me!</h1>
    <hr />
    <p>
        I am a web developer by profession, but a mechanical engineer by heart. I love to visit places, 
        sing songs and play guitar. I have graduated from NIT Durgapur in the year 2021. Since then, I am working here at PwC
        as a consultant. I also play decent badminton. I do have some trophies in Badminton. I have played for PwC at multiple corporate 
        competitions. Although Badminton is my favourite sport, I can play football, cricket, table tennis and carrom. 
        Apart from these, I am also a good swimmer. Fishing is one of my hobbies. I also have a mirrorless
        camera with which, sometimes, I click portraits and landscapes. I edit those photos myself and love to post those
        in social media. Recently, in the past few years, I have developed a good passion for cooking. My 
        friends and colleagues have great admiration for me for my cooking skills. 
        I love to socialize, and can't wait to meet you in person!
